## Overview

* **Base Path**: `/api/v1/attempts`
* **Authentication**: Required for all endpoints. Uses JWT Bearer token in `Authorization` header.
* **Authorization Model**: Ownership-based. Users can only access their own attempts.
* **Content-Type**: `application/json` for requests and responses (except `204` responses)
* **Error Format**: All errors return `ErrorResponse` object (see Error Handling section)

## Authorization Matrix

Unlike admin endpoints which use permission-based authorization, attempt endpoints use **ownership-based authorization**. Users can only interact with their own quiz attempts.

| Capability | Endpoint(s) | Authorization Rule | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Start attempt** | `POST /quizzes/{quizId}` | User must be authenticated | Any authenticated user can start an attempt |
| **List own attempts** | `GET /` | User sees only their own attempts | Filtered by authenticated username |
| **View attempt details** | `GET /{attemptId}` | User must own the attempt | Returns 403 if not the owner |
| **Get current question** | `GET /{attemptId}/current-question` | User must own the attempt | Returns 403 if not the owner |
| **Submit answers** | `POST /{attemptId}/answers`, `POST /{attemptId}/answers/batch` | User must own the attempt | Returns 403 if not the owner |
| **Complete attempt** | `POST /{attemptId}/complete` | User must own the attempt | Returns 403 if not the owner |
| **View stats** | `GET /{attemptId}/stats` | User must own the attempt | Returns 403 if not the owner |
| **Pause/Resume** | `POST /{attemptId}/pause`, `POST /{attemptId}/resume` | User must own the attempt | Returns 403 if not the owner |
| **Delete attempt** | `DELETE /{attemptId}` | User must own the attempt | Returns 403 if not the owner |
| **Review attempt** | `GET /{attemptId}/review`, `GET /{attemptId}/answer-key` | User must own the attempt | Returns 403 if not the owner |
| **Get shuffled questions** | `GET /quizzes/{quizId}/questions/shuffled` | User must have access to quiz | Quiz visibility rules apply |

**Admin Overrides**:
- Admin users with appropriate permissions may access all attempts (implementation-specific)
- Use admin endpoints for cross-user attempt management

**Quiz Access**:
- Starting an attempt requires read access to the quiz
- Quiz visibility (public/private) is enforced at quiz level
- Deleted or closed quizzes cannot be attempted

{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "status": 404,
  "error": "Not Found",
  "details": ["Attempt not found with ID: uuid-here"]
}
```

**Common HTTP Status Codes**:

| Code | Meaning | When to expect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `400` | Bad Request | Validation errors, malformed JSON, invalid enums |
| `401` | Unauthorized | Missing or invalid authentication token |
| `403` | Forbidden | User doesn't own the resource |
| `404` | Not Found | Attempt, quiz, or question doesn't exist |
| `409` | Conflict | Attempt state conflict (e.g., reviewing incomplete attempt) |
| `422` | Unprocessable Entity | Invalid state transition (e.g., getting current question after completion) |
| `500` | Internal Server Error | Unexpected server error |

---

## Integration Guide

### Starting an Attempt Flow

1. **Start attempt**: `POST /quizzes/{quizId}` with optional mode
2. **Get first question**: `GET /{attemptId}/current-question`
3. **Submit answers**:
   - ONE_BY_ONE: `POST /{attemptId}/answers` for each question
   - ALL_AT_ONCE: Collect all answers, then `POST /{attemptId}/answers/batch`
4. **Complete attempt**: `POST /{attemptId}/complete`
5. **View results**: `GET /{attemptId}/review`

### Pause/Resume Flow

- **Pause**: `POST /{attemptId}/pause` (status becomes `PAUSED`)
- **Resume**: `POST /{attemptId}/resume` (status returns to `IN_PROGRESS`)
- **Get current position**: `GET /{attemptId}/current-question`

### Review Features

- **Full review with user answers**: `GET /{attemptId}/review`
- **Answer key only**: `GET /{attemptId}/answer-key`
- **Control visibility**: Use query parameters to show/hide user answers and correct answers

### Error Handling Best Practices

1. Always check `status` code in `ErrorResponse`
2. Display `details` array messages to users (they are user-friendly)
3. Handle 409/422 with clear UI messaging (e.g., "Complete the quiz before viewing review")
4. For batch submissions, check for partial success in error details
5. Implement retry logic for 500 errors

### Validation Tips

- Validate `questionId` format (UUID) before submission
- Ensure `response` structure matches question type
- For MCQ_MULTI, send array even if only one option selected
- For ORDERING, send complete array of all item IDs in desired order
- For batch submissions, ensure no duplicate `questionId` values

## Security Considerations

### Ownership Enforcement

1. **Attempt Isolation**: Users can only access their own attempts
2. **Automatic Filtering**: List endpoints automatically filter by authenticated user
3. **Explicit Checks**: Individual attempt operations validate ownership before processing
4. **403 Responses**: Non-owners receive `403 Forbidden` instead of `404 Not Found` to prevent enumeration

### Token Security

1. **Token Expiry**: Handle token expiration and implement refresh logic
2. **Secure Storage**: Store JWT tokens securely (HttpOnly cookies or secure storage)
3. **Token Validation**: All endpoints validate token signature and expiration
4. **Logout Cleanup**: Clear tokens on logout to prevent reuse

### Answer Integrity

1. **Server-Side Validation**: All answer formats are validated server-side
2. **Timing Protection**: Server timestamps all submissions to prevent tampering
3. **Correct Answer Privacy**: Correct answers are never sent to client during active attempts
4. **Review Access Control**: Review endpoint only accessible after attempt completion

### Quiz Access Control

1. **Quiz Visibility**: Starting attempts respects quiz public/private status
2. **Quiz Availability**: Closed or deleted quizzes cannot be attempted
3. **Question Security**: Shuffled questions endpoint filters based on quiz access
4. **Admin Separation**: Use dedicated admin endpoints for cross-user access

### State Management

1. **Status Transitions**: Server enforces valid state transitions
2. **Completion Protection**: Once completed, attempts cannot be modified
3. **Pause/Resume Guards**: Only `IN_PROGRESS` attempts can be paused
4. **Idempotency**: Multiple identical submissions are handled safely

### Data Privacy

1. **No User Data Leakage**: Attempt responses don't expose other users' data
2. **Stats Privacy**: Statistics only available to attempt owner
3. **Review Controls**: Use query parameters to control sensitive data exposure
4. **Minimal Exposure**: Error messages don't reveal system internals

### Best Practices for Implementation

**Frontend**:
- Never cache correct answers client-side during active attempts
- Implement token refresh before expiration
- Clear sensitive data on logout
- Validate user ownership before rendering attempt data
- Use HTTPS for all API calls

**Mobile Apps**:
- Store tokens in secure storage (Keychain/Keystore)
- Implement certificate pinning for API endpoints
- Clear attempt data from memory after completion
- Handle background/foreground transitions securely

**Testing**:
- Test ownership checks with different user accounts
- Verify correct answers are not leaked in API responses
- Test token expiration handling
