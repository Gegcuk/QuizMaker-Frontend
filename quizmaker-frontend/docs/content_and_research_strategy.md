# Quizzence Content & Research Strategy (SEO-Driven)

A comprehensive, implementation-ready plan to make the Research Hub and blog our primary acquisition engine, drive credibility with evidence-backed summaries, and convert readers into quiz takers and signups.

> Scope: Marketing site content only (Research hub, Blog, Templates, Lead magnet, Email). Engineering tasks are listed as a handoff checklist.

---

## 1) Objectives & Success Metrics

- Primary objectives
  - Build credibility and organic traffic with an evidence-backed Research Hub.
  - Capture search intent around retrieval practice and effective study methods.
  - Convert readers to product actions: try a sample quiz, sign up, or download the Study Playbook.
  - Create evergreen assets that attract organic links from educators and researchers.
  - Why: SEO compounds. Research-backed content fuels E-E-A-T (experience, expertise, authority, trust), improving rankings and conversions.

- Commercial KPIs (90 days)
  - 5k monthly organic sessions (aligned with Production Plan). Why: viability threshold to feed activation funnels.
  - 2.0–3.5% CTR from SERP for core posts. Why: validates title/meta messaging and intent fit.
  - 1.5–3.0% visitor → signup for sample quiz or newsletter. Why: early funnel conversion target for optimization.
  - 30+ referring domains to Research Hub pages. Why: authority growth and durable SEO moat.

- Activation KPIs
  - 60% of new students complete a quiz; 30% start a second (per Production Plan). Content contribution measured via assisted conversions in GA4.

---

## 2) Personas, Intents, and Journeys

- Students (late high school + university)
  - Intents: “how to remember more,” “testing effect explained,” “study after reading,” “quiz before reading benefits.”
  - Journey: Read research summary → try sample quiz → sign up → streaks loop.

- Teachers/Instructors/TAs
  - Intents: “quick quiz templates for class,” “pre-test benefits,” “retrieval practice assignment,” “engagement check ideas.”
  - Journey: Read research summary → open template → import/generate quiz → share link → subscription.

- Why this split: Content must serve two distinct intents and CTAs but share the same evidence base. Mapping prevents “one-post-for-all” dilution.

---

## 3) Content Pillars & Taxonomy

- Research Hub (evergreen, linkable)
  - Topics: Testing Effect, Spacing Effect, Interleaving, Pre-testing, Desirable Difficulties, Metacognition, Transfer-appropriate Processing.
  - Format: Plain-language summaries + classroom/study application + citations.
  - Why: These are cornerstone terms for the niche; strong backlink potential.

- Practical Guides for Teachers
  - Topics: “Assigning pre-tests in under 10 minutes,” “Weekly retrieval practice without extra grading,” “Building low-stakes quizzes for engagement.”
  - Why: Maps to job-to-be-done and product features.

- Study Skills for Students
  - Topics: “Study after reading in 10 minutes,” “How to space your reviews,” “How to use micro-quizzes to prep.”
  - Why: Converts student intent and promotes core loop behavior.

- Templates & Micro-Experiments
  - Topics: “5 quick quiz templates,” “One-week retrieval challenge,” “Pre-test checklist.”
  - Why: Tight CTA alignment; immediate product action.

- Case Studies & Proof
  - Topics: Pilot class outcomes, instructor testimonials, before/after metrics.
  - Why: Social proof compounding with product maturity.

---

## 4) Keyword & Topic Research Workflow

- Inputs & tools
  - Seed list: the seven pillar topics + teacher/study modifiers (classroom, syllabus, assignment, exam prep).
  - Tools: Google Search Console (post-launch), Google Autocomplete/People Also Ask, competitor SERPs, free keyword tools, and manual SERP inspection.
  - Why: We prioritize intent and SERP fit over raw volume; free inputs are sufficient early on.

- Method (repeatable)
  - For each pillar, collect 20–40 variants (head, mid-tail, long-tail). 
  - Inspect top-10 SERP: note formats (definition, how-to, list, academic), content gaps, and common headings.
  - Decide page type: Research Summary vs Guide vs Template based on dominant intent.
  - Keep one primary keyword per page; list 3–5 supporting semantically related terms.
  - Create a Content Brief with: target persona, primary keyword, search intent, H1/H2s, 5 internal links, 3 external citations.
  - Why: “One page, one intent” avoids cannibalization and clarifies writing.

- Success criteria
  - First draft matches dominant SERP format and answers the intent in the first 150 words.
  - Includes a product CTA that logically follows the content’s job-to-be-done.

---

## 5) Information Architecture & URLs

- URL patterns
  - Research: `/research/testing-effect`, `/research/spacing-effect`, `/research/interleaving`, `/research/pre-testing`, etc.
  - Guides: `/blog/how-to-use-pre-testing-in-class`, `/blog/study-after-reading`.
  - Templates: `/templates/quick-quiz-templates`, `/templates/pre-test-checklist`.
  - Why: Predictable, human-readable URLs improve UX and ranking signals.

- Navigation
  - Top nav: Research, Blog, Pricing, For Students, For Teachers, Sample Quiz.
  - Footer: add Research and Blog to reinforce discovery; include Terms/Privacy.
  - Why: Makes the Research Hub a first-class citizen for credibility and links.

- Internal linking
  - Each Research summary links to 2–3 related guides/templates and vice versa.
  - Each guide links back to the canonical Research topic and to Sample Quiz.
  - Why: Distributes authority and guides users to activation.

---

## 6) Content Templates (structure to standardize quality)

  - Ensure clean slugs and canonical tags; add breadcrumb component.

- Components & SEO
  - Shared article layout with schema JSON-LD support (Article, FAQ, BreadcrumbList, optional HowTo).
  - Inline “Try it now” CTA block with configurable target.
  - Table of contents generator; last updated metadata.

- Analytics
  - GA4: implement events listed in Section 13; mark conversions; enable outbound link tracking for citations.

---

## 18) Educational Notes for Junior Managers

- Intent beats volume
  - Pick topics where our product is the “next logical step” after the answer. This drives conversion even at modest volumes.

- One page, one intent
  - Don’t try to rank a single page for multiple distinct intents (e.g., “what is” + “how to implement”). Split them and link between.

- Write for scanners
  - Short paragraphs, descriptive subheads, summary boxes. Readers should get value in 30 seconds.

- Cite like a pro
  - Prefer primary studies and reputable summaries; link to DOIs when possible. Avoid circular citations.

- E-E-A-T in practice
  - Demonstrate expertise by connecting research to practical steps, showing examples, and using author bios with credentials.

- CTAs should feel inevitable
  - If your post solves a job-to-be-done, the CTA should be the obvious next action (e.g., “Try this pre-test template now”).

- Measure learning, not just traffic
  - Track scroll depth, time on page, and CTAs to see if readers engage and act—not just if they arrive.

- Refresh beats rewrite
  - Update high-potential posts with new data and better structure before creating new ones. Compounding wins faster.
