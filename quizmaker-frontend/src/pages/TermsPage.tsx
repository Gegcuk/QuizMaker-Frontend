          <h2>1. Accepting these terms</h2>
          <p>
            By accessing Quizzence you agree to operate within our feature-first architecture and API boundaries. The frontend
            integrates React Router layouts, protected routes for private flows, and axios-powered services that assume secure,
            authenticated requests. Use of the platform signifies your commitment to respecting these constraints and any
            additional agreements reached with the Quizzence team.

        <section className="mb-10">
          <h2>2. Account responsibilities</h2>
          <p>
            You are responsible for safeguarding credentials issued to you. Our authentication hooks rely on valid tokens to
            manage protected quiz creation, document management, and analytics routes. Notify support immediately at
            <a className="ml-1 text-theme-interactive-primary hover:text-theme-interactive-info" href="mailto:support@quizmaker.com">
              support@quizmaker.com

            if you suspect unauthorized activity so we can revoke sessions via our centralized auth services.

          <h2>3. Content ownership & usage</h2>
          <p>
            Quiz content you create remains yours. Granting Quizzence a non-exclusive license allows us to render quizzes through
            our shared UI primitives, store metadata in associated services, and improve recommendation models. You warrant that
            uploaded questions and documents respect copyright and are free from prohibited content.

          <h2>4. Acceptable use</h2>
          <p>
            Do not reverse engineer security features, spam the API, or attempt to bypass role-based routes. Our ProtectedRoute
            component, tagging workflows, and admin tooling keep the community safe. Breaches may lead to account suspension or
            removal.

          <h2>5. Service availability</h2>
          <p>
            We strive for high availability through modular deployments. However, maintenance windows, dependency upgrades, or
            upstream API changes may interrupt service. Critical notices are communicated via the in-app notification centre and
            official social channels listed in the footer.
